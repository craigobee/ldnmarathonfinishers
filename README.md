## Chasing Speed: Why Non-Elite Marathon Times Remain Stagnant Despite Running Tech Advancements
   As a keen runner and technophile, I am keen to analyse running data to confirm if the average non-elite runner is seeing faster finishing times when comparing past and present dataset.
   As time goes on we see more technologically advanced trainers, technology (watches, digital training plans) and educational tips/nutritional information, but is all the investment into these gadgets and illuminous feather light trainers really making a difference, or is clever marketing getting the better of us?
